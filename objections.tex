\subsection{``End-to-end'' principle}
A common argument in favor of net neutrality is the end-to-end principle. [Leg end-to-end principle uit] [1]

Though at first glance this argument seems valid, it has one important weakness: the end to end principle has no intrinsic value. Though the Internet was once designed according to this principle, it is not a valid argument for it to stay that way.

% TODO: Waarom is end-to-end ooit bedacht?

% TODO: Maar end-to-end is wel een mean naar bepaalde ends. Welke ends? Zijn die ends wel gerechtvaardigd?
