On April 3, 2014 the EU passes a law protecting net neutrality~\cite{whittaker2014eu}. This law forces European \acp{ISP} to treat all Internet traffic equally. In this paper we will defend the contrary: Why net neutrality should \emph{not} be regulated. We will first introduce net neutrality to you by giving a historical background and our definition of net neutrality. Afterwards, we will discuss the values behind net neutrality.

This paper then continues as follows: in section~\ref{sec:arguments} we give our arguments for our thesis and in section~\ref{sec:objections} we give some possible objections to our arguments and we refute them. In section~\ref{sec:solution} we give our proposed solution and we conclude the paper in section~\ref{sec:conclusion}.
