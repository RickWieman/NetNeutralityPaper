On April 3, 2014 the EU passes a law about net neutrality~\highlight{[cite]}. In this paper, we will defend why net neutrality should not be maintained. In this introduction, we introduce net neutrality to you by giving some history and the values behind net neutrality. We will also give some definitions and afterwards, we present our thesis.

This paper then continues as follows: in section~\ref{sec:arguments} we give our arguments for our thesis and in section~\ref{sec:objections} we give some possible objections to our arguments and we refute them. In section~\ref{sec:solution} we give our proposed solution and we conclude the paper in section~\ref{sec:conclusion}.
