The net neutrality debate is a complicated one, because many arguments fail to address the right values. This is not surprising, as there is no clear definition of net neutrality.

Some of the proponent's arguments are just. Without net neutrality, some of the values underlying these arguments, such as transparancy and technical innovation, could be at risk. We differ from net neutrality proponents in that we don't think that net neutrality is the right way to secure these values.

An all-or-nothing approach is not likely to last, because it ignores the delicate aspects of the Internet. Instead, we think that the debate should focus more on a hybrid approach in with checks and balances.
