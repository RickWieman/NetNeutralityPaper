% Intro + technological innovation
Before further elaborating on the issue, we need to develop a deeper understanding of the values underlying the net neutrality debate. First of all, \emph{technological innovation} is at stake. Proponents of net neutrality argue that without it, startups will have a hard time `getting of the ground'. Opponents on the other hand argue that net neutrality inhibits innovation. ISPs have an incentive to innovate and gain competitive advantage, but net neutrality laws constrain their possibilities. Furthermore, net neutrality prevents engineers from creating new (latency sensitive) applications, such as video conferencing.
